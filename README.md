# klipper_backup
Klipper config files for my Ender 5 Plus, BTT Octopus v1.1

It's nothing that interesting, it's most likley not relevant to people!

But I wanted a backup, so I set one up using this script.

After fighting a git version issue, got it working so happy now that I have at least some regular and automatied backup of my config file.

Enjoy!
